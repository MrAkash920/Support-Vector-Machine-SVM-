## Introduction
Support Vector Machines are a class of supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They have gained immense popularity in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and finance. This repository serves as your one-stop resource to understand, implement, and master SVM.

## Why SVM?
- **Versatile**: SVM can be used for both classification and regression problems.
- **Effective**: It is particularly powerful when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data.
- **Robust**: SVM is less prone to overfitting, making it a reliable choice for many tasks.
- **Kernel Trick**: SVM can handle non-linear relationships between features through kernel functions.
- **Interpretability**: It provides insights into which data points are crucial for classification.
